    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay eggplant slices on paper towels; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let

        </li>
        <li>Warm olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Fry eggplant until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels; set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in ground beef, onions, and garlic; season with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add parsley, fines herbs, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Pour in tomato sauce and wine; mix well. Simmer for 20 minutes. Allow to cool, then stir in beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Scald milk in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour into butter until smooth. Lower heat; gradually pour in scalded milk, whisking constantly until it thickens. Season béchamel sauce with salt and white pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange a single layer of eggplant in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cover eggplant with meat sauce, then sprinkle 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese on top. Cover with remaining eggplant and sprinkle another 1/2 cup cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Pour béchamel sauce on top and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Cover with remaining cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and browned, about 1 hour.</li>
